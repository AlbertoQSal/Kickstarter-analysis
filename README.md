# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

In this project we analalized the trends of different kinds of kickstarters campaigns, so we can learn about the mean goal of the campains, the mean pledge and the date when the campaigns started and how this affects their success.

We found out that between the years 2009 and 2017 there were 1393 theater kickstarter campaigns all aroaund the world. Out of the 1393 theater kickstarter campaigns 37 were canceled, 493 failed, 24 are live and 829 were successful.

According to the analysis performed in the US theater/plays Kickstrters Campaigns we found out that the Mean goal of the successful campaigns was $5,049 with a Median goal of $3,000 and the Mean goal of the failed campaigns was $10,554 with a Median goal of $5,000. We can concluded based on this infomation that the campaigns should have a goal smaller than $5,000 and also, based on te Upper Quartile of goal of the successful campaigns we know that 75% of the succesful campaigns had a goal smaller than $5,000.

Respect to the investigation on musicals in Great Britain we can conclued that the mean goal is around £4,000. This exceed the upper limit of the range of outliers for amount pledge, so you should probably try to produced your play for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
